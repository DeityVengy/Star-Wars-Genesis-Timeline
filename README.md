## Timeline

### 14 BDT (1 year before Phantom Menace)
- The Yuuzhan Vong enter the timeline from the World between Worlds

### 13 BDT (same year as Phantom Menace)
- The Yuuzhan Vong kill Darth Plageius and indoctrinate his apprentice, sending him off as a Senator for Coruscant.
- The Yuuzhan Vong fund the creation of a clone army with Plageius’ former wealth and give ownership and authority of it over to the Republic
- The Yuuzhan Vong order the early design and construction of an “Orbital Battle Station” at Taris Shipyards under the false request of the Galactic Republic
- Under the manipulation of the Yuuzhan Vong, the Queen signs the Treaty of Naboo and allows the occupation of the planet by the Trade Federation

### 3 BDT (same year as original clone wars)
- The Trade Federation discovers the Republic’s plans to build an Orbital Battle Station and declares war. The Senate vote to remove the current Chancellor from office and appoint the indoctrinated Palpatine as a replacement.
- The Republic discovers the clone army on Kamino and officially begins the Clone Wars at the Battle of Geonosis.

### 1 BDT
