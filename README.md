- The Yuuzhan Vong enter the timeline from the World between Worlds

### 7945 C.R.C. (same year as Phantom Menace)
- The Yuuzhan Vong kill Darth Plageius and indoctrinate his apprentice, sending him off as a Senator for Coruscant.
- The Yuuzhan Vong fund the creation of a clone army with Plageius’ former wealth and give ownership and authority of it over to the Republic
- The Yuuzhan Vong order the early design and construction of an “Orbital Battle Station” at Taris Shipyards under the false request of the Galactic Republic
- Under the manipulation of the Yuuzhan Vong, the Queen signs the Treaty of Naboo and allows the occupation of the planet by the Trade Federation

### 7955 C.R.C. (same year as original clone wars)
- The Trade Federation discovers the Republic’s plans to build an Orbital Battle Station and declares war. The Senate vote to remove the current Chancellor from office and appoint the indoctrinated Palpatine as a replacement.

### 7958 C.R.C. (same year as original Revenge of the Sith)
- The Shadow Collective is formed on Mandalore by Darth Maul. The Neo Crusaders are founded in response by an unknown individual, presumably Nom Anor.
- The surface of Taris is seemingly vaporized, killing trillions and leaving only remnants of the former civilization. The Republic and Trade Federation agree to a ceasefire and sign a peace treaty shortly after.
- The Trade Federation becomes the Galaxy’s main Trade Authority. The Republic is re-formed into an Empire with Palpatine as Emperor. The Jedi Order is wiped out and all existing clones are slowly decommissioned.

### 7959 C.R.C. (THIS IS WHERE THINGS DEVIATE IMMENSELY)

- The remaining Shadow Collective ally with various pirate gangs and retaliate by attacking a Star Destroyer above Mandalore.
